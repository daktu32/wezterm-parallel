## Getting Started

1. **Choose your prompt** based on the criteria above
2. **Copy the prompt content** to your project
3. **Customize file paths** in the `<file_paths>` section
4. **Set up required files** (PRD, architecture docs, etc.)
5. **Configure `.claude/settings.json`** from the template
6. **Start development** with `/bootstrap` command

## Customization

Each prompt can be customized by:

### Adjusting Quality Gates
```yaml
# Example: Lowering test coverage for faster development
test_coverage_requirements:
  standard_features:
    line_coverage: "â‰¥60%"  # Reduced from 80%
```

### Modifying Approval Process
```yaml
# Example: Removing approval gates for faster iteration
human_approval_gate:
  approver: "None"  # Skip manual approval
  auto_approve: true
```

### Adding Custom Phases
```yaml
# Example: Adding a performance testing phase
phase4_5_performance:
  performance_requirements:
    - load_testing: "Handle 1000 concurrent users"
    - response_time: "API responses < 200ms"
```

## Mixing Prompts

You can combine elements from different prompts:

### Example: Startup + Open Source
- Use Startup Development base
- Add Open Source community features
- Include RFC process for major changes

### Example: Basic + Enterprise Security
- Use Basic Development workflow
- Add Enterprise security requirements
- Include compliance checkpoints

## File Path Configuration

Update the `<file_paths>` section in your chosen prompt:

```yaml
<file_paths>
product_requirements = "./docs/prd.md"
architecture          = "./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md"
tech_stack            = "./docs/tech-stack.md"
ci_pipeline           = "./.github/workflows/ci.yml"
deployment_env        = "./infrastructure/deployment-env.yaml"
development_roadmap   = "./DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md"
contributing_guide    = "./CONTRIBUTING.md"
claude_settings       = "./.claude/settings.json"
claude_guidelines     = "./CLAUDE.md"
</file_paths>
```

## Integration with Claude Code

1. **Place your chosen prompt** in the root of your project
2. **Reference it in your Claude Code session** when starting development
3. **Use the defined commands** (`/approve`, `/error_status`, etc.)
4. **Follow the phase progression** as defined in your prompt
