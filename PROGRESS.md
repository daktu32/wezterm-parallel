## Decisions Made

### Technical Decisions
- **TypeScript for Setup Assistant**: Provides type safety and better developer experience for complex CLI logic
- **Inquirer.js for Interactive CLI**: Industry standard with excellent UX for command-line interactions
- **Mustache for Template Processing**: Simple, logic-less templating that's secure and maintainable
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns (promptSelector, templateProcessor, fileManager, validator) for maintainability
- **Backup System**: Timestamped backups prevent data loss during customization process

### Process Decisions
- **Dry-run Mode First**: Always provide preview functionality before making changes
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality, add advanced features incrementally
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every feature requires documentation before implementation
- **User-Centric Design**: All decisions prioritize developer experience and ease of use
