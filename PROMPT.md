#    ────────────────────────────────────────
## BOOTSTRAP (automatic) → Phase1 … Phase5
#  - Phases cannot complete without human command: /approve <phase>
#  - Retry bootstrap after error fixes: /retry_bootstrap
#  - Error handling commands: /error_status, /retry_with_fix <code>

### BOOTSTRAP Phase (Scrum Master, automatic execution)

#### File Validation
1. Verify all paths in <file_paths> exist
2. Run comprehensive validation checks:

#### Content Validation Rules
```yaml
validation_rules:
  product_requirements:
    - rule: "contains_user_stories"
      pattern: "## User Stories|# User Stories|As a .* I want"
      min_count: 1
      error_code: "BOOTSTRAP_101"
      severity: "CRITICAL"
      
  ci_pipeline:
    - rule: "has_required_keys"
      required_keys: ["on", "jobs"]
      error_code: "BOOTSTRAP_102" 
      severity: "CRITICAL"
      
  claude_settings:
    - rule: "valid_json_schema"
      schema_keys: ["project_name", "environment"]
      error_code: "BOOTSTRAP_103"
      severity: "CRITICAL"
```

3. On failure:
   • Log: "[TIMESTAMP] [ERROR_CODE] [BOOTSTRAP] [ROLE] [SEVERITY] <message>"
   • Notify Project Manager with structured error report
   • Halt further phases until /retry_bootstrap
